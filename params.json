It is amazingly amazing, and awesomely awesome.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n----------\r\nIn your Knockout ViewModel:\r\n```javascript\r\nthis.clicks = ko.observable().now('clicks');\r\n```\r\nand that's it ... **really**!  Now your data-bound views will automagically update; whenever ``` now.clicks ``` is changed from the server.\r\ni.e.\r\n```javascript\r\neveryone.now.clicks += 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it any good?\r\n---------------------\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n---------\r\nDue to a bug, in the *last* release of Now.js (0.8.1).  You must use my branch, this can be done by adding a dependency to your package.json file like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n\"now\": \"git://github.com/jameskeane/now.git\",\r\n```"}
